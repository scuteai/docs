# Getting your scute credentials

Go to [control.scute.io](https://control.scute.io) and create an account if you don't already have one. Create a new app using the "Create new app" button in the top right corner of the dashboard. Enter a name for your app and enter the domain name that your app will live under.

Once your app is created you will be redirected to your App Dashboard. From the sidebar select "API Keys" and you can find your credentials for the newly created app.
